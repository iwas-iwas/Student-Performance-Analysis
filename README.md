# Student Performance Project

## Motivation:

Analysis of scores from three different exams and a variety of personal, social, and economic factors that have interaction effects upon them. The goal is to see which of those factors contribute to scoring better/worse in exams. This could give students and individual schools helpful insights. In the end, I also built a classifier that predicts whether a student will score above or below average based on certain factors.


## Tools:

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn 

## Structure:

**Initial Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing**
  - Display of basic dataset statistics
  - visualizing average exam distribution
  - preprocessing the data for in depth analysis of the following questions

**Analysis**
  
1. Do students with parents that have a college degree perform better?

2. Does having a free/reduced meal have an impact on the performance?

3. The Gender race: Who scores better in which subject? Who scores better in total?

4. Does having a good score in one subject contribute to having a good score in another subject?

5. Do race differences show different performances?

6. Do people that complete the test preparation course score higher?

**Predict performance**

- SVM to predict above or below average performance 

**Conclusion**

- Breaking down the results for the questions in the Analysis 

**Next Steps**

- Currently working on a interative dash-plotly dashboard where a user can input the different factors discussed in the project and get's the performance of students as output
