# Student Performance Project - Iwas Iwas

## Tools:

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn 

## Structure:

**- Initial Exploratory Data Analysis and Preprocessing**
  - Display of basic dataset statistics
  - visualizing average exam distribution
  - preprocessing the data for in depth analysis of the following questions

**-Analysis**
  
1. Do students with parents that have a college degree perform better?

2. Does having a free/reduced meal have an impact on the performance?

3. The Gender race: Who scores better in which subject? Who scores better in total?

4. Does having a good score in one subject contribute to having a good score in another subject?

5. Do race differences show different performances?

6. Do people that complete the test preparation course score higher?

**-Predict performance**

- SVM to predict above or below average performance 

**-Conclusion**

- Breaking down the results for the questions in the Analysis
